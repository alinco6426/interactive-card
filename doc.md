Card Information Input Form with Validation - Documentation
Introduction
This JavaScript code is designed to implement a card information input form with validation. The form collects essential card details such as the cardholder's name, card number, expiration date, and card code (CVC). It validates the input to ensure that the user provides accurate and valid card information.

Usage
To use this card information input form, you need to include the provided HTML structure in your web page. This structure contains the necessary elements to display the form and collect user input.

Form Validation
The form validation process is divided into two main functions: inputValidation and formValidation.

inputValidation()
This function is responsible for validating each input field individually. It iterates over all the input fields and checks for empty values. If any field is empty, it displays an error message indicating that the field can't be empty. If all fields are filled, it clears any error messages related to those fields.

formValidation()
The formValidation() function handles the overall validation of the form. It calls the inputValidation() function to ensure that individual input fields are validated. In addition to the checks performed in inputValidation(), this function includes specific validation rules for each input field:

Cardholder's Name: It requires the name to include only alphabetic characters (both upper and lower case) and spaces. If the name is not provided or contains invalid characters, an appropriate error message is displayed.

Card Number: It requires the card number to include only numeric digits and be exactly 16 characters long. If the card number is not provided or has an invalid format, an error message is displayed.

Expiration Date (MM/YY): The expiration date requires two numeric digits for both the month and year. The month should be between 01 and 12, and the year should be within the current century (e.g., 20 for the 2020s). If the input is not provided or has an invalid format, the relevant error message is displayed.

Card Code (CVC): The card code requires three numeric digits. If the input is not provided or has an invalid format, an error message is displayed.

Event Listeners
Event listeners are set up for each input field to trigger the validation process whenever the user interacts with the form. The input event is used to validate the input while the user types, and the blur event is used to validate the input when the user moves away from the input field.

Feedback
If all inputs are valid, the form displays a feedback message indicating that the card information has been confirmed.

Enhancements
The current implementation provides basic validation for each input field, but it can be further enhanced with additional features, such as:

Enhancing the user interface with CSS styles to improve visual feedback.
Preventing form submission if there are validation errors and displaying appropriate error messages.
Handling special validation cases, such as validating the card number against a specific card issuer's rules.
Providing better error messages that are more informative and user-friendly.
Ensuring a secure and encrypted connection when submitting sensitive card information.
Conclusion
The provided JavaScript code offers a foundation for implementing a card information input form with validation. By using this code as a starting point and enhancing it further, you can create a more robust and user-friendly form to collect and validate card details effectively.
